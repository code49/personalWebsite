# personalWebsite

## purpose:

The purpose of this program is simple: produce a nice personal website, preferably one simple enough to keep updated that it actually is.

## design guide:

For tracking purposes, here is the colour schema for the site:

- "primary" colour: #F7F7F7 (grey, for backgrounds)
- "secondary" colour: #C20101 (red, for accents)
- "tertiary" colour: #EEE4E4 (peach, for slight background contrast)

- "primary" text colour: #121011 (black, for most text pieeces)
- "secondary" text colour: #FFFFFF (white, for when contrast is needed)

There are also two fonts being used:

- "serif": simple written text
- "monospace": code-related text
